# DOS Detection
This project, created as part of the **Programming 3** course, is a simple application built to simulate and explore **Denial of Service (DOS) attacks**. It demonstrates both the sending and processing of packets to a server, showcasing how servers behave under normal and attack conditions.
## Features
- **Packet Sender**: Sends different types of packets to a specified port and host.
- **DOS Detector**: Creates a server that handles incoming packet traffic.
- **App Class**: Provides the user interface for interacting with the application.

## Usage
1. Press the **Start** button to begin the simulation.
    - Observe how the server processes incoming packets and behaves normally.

2. If you become bored, click the **Attack** button to simulate a DOS attack by sending empty packets to the server.
    - Watch how the server reacts under the load of empty packets.

## Requirements
- **Java SDK 21** or later
- Any required dependencies (e.g., JavaFX for the user interface, if applicable)
- Ensure the **HOST** is properly selected and reachable.

## Setup and Running the Project
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Make sure the project is using **Java SDK 21**.
4. If there's a `HOST` selection, ensure it is set correctly in the application.
5. Run the project:
    - From the IDE, execute the `App` class.
    - Alternatively, build the application into a runnable JAR and execute it.
